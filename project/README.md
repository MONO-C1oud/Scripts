This is a very basic cryptography toolkit which uses openssl to encrypt/decrypt files and also a a very basic md5 hash cracker.
This is my first python script and I hope it helps out all of you :)

To run the script, just type in the console:
python3 toolkit.py

Make sure you first navigate to the directory which was toolkit.py

see ya :p
